<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I am studying computer science at the university of Calgary and going into my second 
  year this fall. I love it there.
</p>

<p>I moved to Canada when I was 6. We first lived in Toronto for 7 years
  then moved to Cochrane Alberta in 2015 and since then I have been here.
